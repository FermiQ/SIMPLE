Creating tutorials
----------------------------------------------

Tutorials are found in $SIMPLE_PATH/tutorials. These files have an extension of .tut and the filename is interpreted as the tutorial name in the tutorial window launched from the gui.

The contents of the .tut files is in JSON format and is self explanatory from the examples. Create elements within the pages array with title, description and html tags.

To generate the html :
1) in the running gui, generate the view that you want. shift-click will highlight and important elements with a red border.
2) ctrl-x
3) in the .tut file, paste the contents of the clipboard into the html tag. Will be a filename eg. 12345.html
